As an exam, you can pick one of these kaggle challenges.

You have to download the data from kaggle. You only need the training data,
unless you want to submit your solution on kaggle, which you can if you want.

For all challenges your task will be to:

- load the data,
- visualize the data,
- compute relevant summary statistics for the data,
- train a linear model to solve the respective task,
- train a non-linear machine learning algorithm of your choice to solve the respective task,
  - ideally, this model should perform better than the linear model 
- evaluate, visualize and compare the performance of your linear and non-linear algorithms,
- describe your findings: which input variable(s) in X are most important to predict the output variable (y)? 

Copying existing solutions results in failing the exam,
so try to solve the challenge on your own.
