As an exam, you can pick one of these kaggle challenges.

You have to download the data from kaggle. You only need the training data,
unless you want to submit your solution on kaggle, which you can if you want.

For all challenges your task will be to:

- load the data,
- visualize the data,
- compute relevant summary statistics for the data,
- train a machine learning algorithm to solve the respective task,
- evaluate and visualize the performance of your algorithm.

Copying existing solutions results in failing the exam,
so try to solve the challenge on your own.
