    "## Structure from motion (7,++) \n",
    "\n",
    "Write some code qualitatively replicating the structure-by-motion stimulus used in Lamme et al. (1998). The stimulus is a random dot pattern in which a central square region of dots moves in one direction (by a tiny amount and for a very brief time) and the background of dots moves in the opposite direction, leading to the percept of a square hovering above the background. The figure displaying the animated graphics should feature some GUI elements, minimally a ‘start’ or ‘go’ button, and one uicontrol each for the amount and duration of movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating a proper stimulus is more difficult than may appear at first sight: the task is not simply one of shifting dots. You will e.g. have to take care of the ‘gaps’ that arise from shifting the central square of dots, etc.\n",
